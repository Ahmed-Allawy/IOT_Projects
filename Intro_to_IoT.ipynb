        "**Kevin Ashton**, coined the phrase “Internet of Things” in 1999. He was the first to describe the IoT, while making a presentation for Procter & Gamble, but the definition of the IoT has evolved over time. Mr. Ashton stated:\n",
        "\n",
        "“Today computers, and, therefore, the Internet, are almost wholly **dependent on human** beings for information. Nearly all of the roughly 50 petabytes of data available on the Internet were first captured and created by human beings by typing, pressing a record button, taking a digital picture or scanning a barcode. The problem is, people have limited time, attention, and accuracy. All of which means they are not very good at capturing data about things in the real world. If we had computers that knew everything there was to know about things, **using data they gathered without any help from us**, we would be able to **track** and count everything and greatly **reduce waste, loss, and cost**. We would know when things needed **replacing, repairing, or recalling and whether they were fresh, or past their best**.”\n",
